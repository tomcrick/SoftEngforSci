\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Scientific software development represents a borderland in the
explosion of code. It combines problems and people in a unique way;
the scientists involved are not programmers, and do not typically have
the skill sets and broader awareness of standard approaches to ensure
code reliability.  Fixing this is however not just issue of education
or culture; in contrast to the shifting specifications an industry
programmer may face, the specifications for scientific software may
simply not exist. People will approach problems from multiple angles,
effectively panning for scientific gold, unsure of their tools and
reliant on their own judgement.  The fundamental problem --- not
knowing what the ``right'' answer should be, whilst attempting to make
reproducible discoveries --- requires a modified approach. Here we
detail the pressures and problems of working in this rarefied
environment, and highlight lessons which are valuable for both
scientific and software cultures.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Outline}

In this chapter, we will discuss not only the issues which may arise
in interdisciplinary work but also to draw out the characteristics of
research scientific software development and how it is distinguished
from conventional software engineering. We will highlight the issues
which arise that are unique to research software and how we have
encountered and (sometimes) successfully overcome them. We will draw
from our wide range of experiences, but specifically focusing on two
key scientific software projects which we have been involved with: the
BioModelAnalyzer\footnote{\url{http://biomodelanalyzer.research.microsoft.com/}}~\cite{benque-et-al:2012};
and the more recent, related Cellular Dynamics
Engine~\cite{hall-et-al:2015}. We intend to cover specifically:

\begin{itemize}
\item The challenges of testing in an environment where behaviours 
	are not known \emph{a priori}; 
\item Balancing scientific requirements (such as implementing alternative 
	approaches rapidly) against common engineering needs of code optimisation, 
	readability, etc; 
\item user driven discovery: the unexpected identification of 
	scientific/algorithmic issues;
\item Issues encountered when separating models and code; 
\item The linking of {\em in vivo} and {\em in silico} work flows;
\item Issues encountered in maintaining a scientific codebase in a diverse, 
cross-disciplinary project; 
\item Issues encountered in maintaining and extending a model database in a diverse, cross-disciplinary project;
\item User interface development to help in cross-disciplinary work;
\item Practices that we used but should be more widely adopted in
  scientific environments, for example: version control, unit testing,
  continuous integration, code review, robust documentation, etc. 
\end{itemize}

We envisage this chapter sitting in {\emph{Section I: Examples of the
Application of Traditional Software Engineering Practices to
Science}}, as it will describe generalisable experiences with applying
modern software engineering practices to the development,
particularly, of scientific software. We will illustrate our narrative
with appropriate case studies and real world examples.

\section*{Authors}

The three authors have wide experience of scientific software
engineering, from real-world tool development across a number of
application domains, through to associated policy. They have
previously published work in this space, focusing on reproducibility
and sharing of scientific software
models~\cite{crick-et-al_wssspe2,crick-et-al_recomp2014}, as well as
proposing e-infrastructure and workflow models for encouraging and
supporting reproducibility in computational science and
engineering\footnote{\url{http://arxiv.org/a/crick_t_1.html}}.

Dr Tom Crick\footnote{\url{http://drtomcrick.com}} is a Senior
Lecturer in Computing Science at Cardiff Metropolitan University,
having completed his PhD and post-doctoral research at the University
of Bath. His research interests cut across computational science:
knowledge representation and reasoning, optimisation, big data, social
network analysis and high performance computing. He is the Nesta Data
Science Fellow, a 2014 Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute
(EPSRC) and a member of {\emph{HiPEAC}}, the European FP7 Network of
Excellence on High Performance and Embedded Architecture and
Compilation.

Dr Benjamin
A. Hall\footnote{\url{http://www.mrc-cu.cam.ac.uk/hall.html}} is a
Royal Society University Research Fellow, developing hybrid and formal
models of carcinogenesis and biological signalling at the MRC Cancer
Unit, University of Cambridge. He previously worked at Microsoft
Research Cambridge (on BioModelAnalyzer with Jasmine Fisher), UCL and
the University of Oxford. As part of his role at Oxford, he was one of
two Apple Laureates, awarded by Apple and the Oxford Supercomputing
Centre for the project {\emph{A biomolecular simulation
pipeline}}. Benjamin has an MBiochem and DPhil from the University of
Oxford.

Dr Samin
Ishtiaq\footnote{\url{http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/sishtiaq/}}
is Principal Engineer in the Programming Principles and Tools group at
Microsoft Research Cambridge. He currently works on the SLAyer
(Separation Logic-based memory safety for C programs), TERMINATOR
(program termination) and BMA projects. Samin joined MSR in April
2008. Before that (2000-2008), he worked in CPU modelling and
verification at ARM, helping to tape-out the Cortex A8, Cortex M3 and
SC300 processors, and the AMBA bus protocol checker. Samin has an MEng
from Imperial and a PhD in dependent type theory from Queen Mary.
